# Abstract 
We propose an improved algorithm for calculating Avnir’s continuous sym-metry and chirality measures of molecules. These measures evaluate the deviation ofa given structure from symmetry by calculating the distance between the structure andits nearest symmetric counterpart. Our new algorithm utilizes structural properties ofthe given molecule to increase the accuracy of the calculation and dramatically reducethe running time by up to tens orders of magnitude. Consequently, a wide variety ofmolecules of medium size with ca. 100 atoms and even more can be analyzed withinseconds. Numerical evidence of the algorithm’s efﬁciency is presented for several fam-ilies of molecules such as helicenes, porphyrins, dendrimers building blocks, fullereneand more. The ease and efﬁciency of the calculation make the continuous symmetryand chirality measures promising descriptors for integration in quantitative structure–activity relationship tools, as well as chemical databases and molecular visualizationsoftware.
