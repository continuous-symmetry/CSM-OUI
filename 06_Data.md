Symmetry is a fascinating structural property of matter. Many molecular systems tend to create symmetric structures. While the common view of symmetry is dichotomous â€“ a molecule is considered either symmetric or not - numerous experimental and theoretical measurements show that approximate symmetry is much more common.
