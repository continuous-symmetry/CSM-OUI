Symmetry is a fascinating structural property of matter. Many molecular systems tend to create symmetric structures. While the common view of symmetry is dichotomous â€“ a molecule is considered either symmetric or not - numerous experimental and theoretical measurements show that approximate symmetry is much more common. One may ask then how far from symmetry is a given molecular structure or "what is the symmetry content of a molecule". The continuous symmetry measures (CSM), originally developed by [Prof. David Avnir](http://www.csm.huji.ac.il/new/), answers these questions by quantifying the level of symmetry of a given structure and providing a new terminology for symmetry analysis. Our group focuses on improving the method for a variety of molecular structure, and applying it to study various phenomena that involve approximate symmetry and chirality.
