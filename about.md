Symmetry is a fascinating structural property of matter. Many molecular systems tend to create symmetric structures. While the common view of symmetry is dichotomous â€“ a molecule is considered either symmetric or not - numerous experimental and theoretical measurements show that approximate symmetry is much more common. One may ask then how far from symmetry is a given molecular structure or "what is the symmetry content of a molecule". The continuous symmetry measures (CSM) answer these questions by quantifying the level of symmetry of a given structure and provide a new terminology for symmetry analysis. Our group focuses on improving the method and it applications to study various phenomenon that involve approximate symmetry and chirality.
